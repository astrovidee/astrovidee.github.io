Hi! I am Vidya Venkatesan, a Ph.D. student in Astrophysics at the University of California, Irvine. I work with Professor Aomawa L. Shields to explore the climate and habitability of exoplanets. My current NASA FINESST-funded project investigates how the interaction between the host star's spectrum and a planet's surface composition shapes the habitability and observability of extrasolar planets using a suite of climate models.

In addition to research, I am passionate about teaching and exploring effective pedagogy techniques. As a Calbridge Pedagogy Scholar and a CSU Pre-Professor Scholar, I am committed to developing inclusive, evidence-based teaching practices. I also serve as the lead facilitator of the Rising Stargirls program and collaborate on DEI initiatives with Cal-Bridge and the UCI PACE program. 

Originally from India, I came to the U.S. after high school to attend California State University, Northridge, where I discovered my passion for physics while working as a telescope operator at the university's solar observatory. Despite limited internship opportunities for international students, I secured summer research positions at Stanford University and the University of California, Irvine, experiences that helped equip me with the skills and networks necessary to pursue a Ph.D. Outside of research, I enjoy reading and watching science fiction, traveling to new countries and national parks, and swing and salsa dancing.
