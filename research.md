# Cold Planets, Fresh Eyes

In **Venkatesan et al. (2025)**, we explored the habitability of eccentric extrasolar planets, which constitute ~20% of the known planetary population but remain underexplored in climate studies. Our findings revealed that above **e ≳ 0.3**, these planets experience extreme cooling at apoastron, forming **CO₂ ice** in addition to water ice. This highlights the importance of including parameterizations for CO₂ ice in climate models when modeling eccentric planets. Our work was featured on the **front cover** of the 25th-anniversary issue of *Astrobiology*.
